Functions that move the vehicle by specifying the velocity components in each direction.
The two functions use different MAVLink commands. The main difference is
that depending on the frame used, the NED velocity can be relative to the vehicle
orientation.

The methods include:
* send_ned_velocity - Sets velocity components using SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command
* send_global_velocity - Sets velocity components using SET_POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT command
