guided_set_speed_yaw.py: (Copter Only)

This example shows how to move/direct Copter and send commands in GUIDED mode using DroneKit Python.

    It is important to remember that in this frame, positive altitudes are entered as negative
    "Down" values. So if down is "10", this will be 10 metres below the home altitude.

    Starting from AC3.3 the method respects the frame setting. Prior to that the frame was
    ignored. For more information see:
